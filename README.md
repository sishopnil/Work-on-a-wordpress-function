# Work-on-a-wordpress-function
A function for wordpress functions.php to grab the Current URL, pass it through the URL, to another page that has a text field.
I need a short code to insert in wordpress's fuction.php to create a button which will redirect from page 1 to page 2 and in  page 2 there will be text box which will display the url of page 1.
